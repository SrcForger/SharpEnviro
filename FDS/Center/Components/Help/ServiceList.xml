  <Label bold="1">Global Services</Label>

  <Label bold="1">Disabling and Restarting Services</Label>
  <Label>Some services, if not used, can be disable in order to free up system ressources. If you for example do not use the virtual window manager (VWM) or weather functionality then you can simply disable those services. Be careful however to not disable important services which are still used by the shell. Disabled services will be listed on the 'Disabled' tab, those services won't be started automatically. If you want to just restart a service then there is no need to disable it, simply click on 'Stop' and click the 'Start' link afterwards.</Label>
