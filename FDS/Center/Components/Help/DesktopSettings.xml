  <Label>However, SharpEnviro also makes it possible to continue using the old explorer desktop. To do so you can enable the Enable Explorer Desktop option. With this option enabled the old explorer desktop will be used.</Label>
  <Label>It's also possible to use the actions !DeskExplorer and !DeskSharpE to quickly switch between the SharpEnviro desktop and the Explorer desktop.</Label>
